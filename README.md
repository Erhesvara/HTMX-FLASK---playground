## Course Summary

**htmx** is a very compelling technology. It's one of the first legitimate libraries that delivers on the promise of dynamic, interactive web applications without complex JavaScript. **htmx allows us to write server-side code in any language** (Python in our case) and, through a few simple HTML attributes, bring our pages to life.

This is the only course (that we're aware of) that shows you the full lifecycle of building Python and Flask-based applications centered around **htmx**. Unlike basic tutorials where you'll find only just quick coverage of a simple feature, we take a full-fledged web app and extend it by adding three real-world features all building upon **htmx**.

**Moreover, we show you the right way to use htmx with Flask and Python**. The resulting code is incredibly clean and would impress almost any professional web developer.

## What topics are covered

In this course, you will:

- **See how htmx differs** from common JavaScript front-end frameworks such as Vue and React.
- **Understand the server-side exchange** enabled by htmx attributes (e.g. `hx-trigger`).
- Add **click to edit** to an existing data-driven Flask application.
- **Learn about the `jinja-partials` package** to refactor our jinja2 templates (with or without htmx).
- **Add deep linking to our dynamic web application**, allowing us to share links into interactive segments.
- Add **active search** to an existing data-driven Flask application.
- **Implement browser history for htmx actions** (allowing back and forth navigation).
- Add **infinite scroll** to our app.
- **Distinguish between full page requests and partial htmx requests** within a single view method in Flask.
- And lots more

All the initial code are from **Talk Python Training** in their course "HTMX + Flask: Modern Python Web Apps, Hold the JavaScript"

_I'll just use their initial code for my HTMX + Flask Playground and training purpose only._
